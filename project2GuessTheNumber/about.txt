We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guss it.

if player's guess is higher then the actual number, the program displays "Lower number please".
Similarly if the user guess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please".
when the user guess the correct number, the program display the number of guess the player used to arrive at the number.

and if player makes high scrore then congratulate the player.
